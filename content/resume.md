I am a Computer Vision researcher interested in Document Analysis and
Optical Music Recognition. I also have interests in other Computer Science-related
technologies such as Compiler Construction or Language Processing.

I am currently looking for a Ph. D. Scholarship in order to dedicate myself to
the development of intelligent music reading systems.
