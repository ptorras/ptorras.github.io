# Some context

I like to think of myself as an attacking, albeit solid, chess player. I like
having a small advantage and the initiative and slowly push forward for a win.
With the black pieces this is usually harder, but with years of trying out
openings and adjusting them to my style I have found that the Sicilian defense
has many lines which suit myself well.

Nevertheless, there are some days where one is not really that into playing a
hard-fought game and going home early is just as good of an option as 
winning. This is more or less the train of thought that I was following when I
was preparing for the fifth round of the swiss tournament I am currently
playing in Santa Eulàlia de Ronçana, in which I was paired against a stronger
and younger opponent (not that I am really that old, but I digress). Therefore
I decided it was a good day to test out the Petroff Defense, an opening I had
toyed with for quite some time. I have some interesting (and also a fair share
of straight up dumb) ideas on these lines, and I wanted to give them a run for 
their money.

# The lines I prepared but didn't play

Unfortunately, in a single game of chess you can only put one line to test. All
hours of study devoted to anything other than that line are put on hold, with
only the possibility of importing ideas here and there should the game somehow
deviate into a similar position.

In order to play the Petroff there are some lines one should at the very least 
be acquainted with. They are not particularly dangerous once studied, but they
do require some precise play in order not to be utterly lost in a few moves.

## The infamous Cochrane Gambit

I was not really expecting this opening to occur at all, but again, it's 
better to be safe than sorry. The characteristic moves of this variation are

> 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nxf7!? Kxf7

Now black has lost castling rights and has some issues getting the pieces out to
active squares. Or does he?

The truth is that most of white's quick threats have concrete answers with which
it is somewhat easy to get a decent game going. For instance, this line:

> 5. Bc4+!? Be6! 6. Bxe6 Kxe6

![An even scarier position with the king on e6 yet no danger to be seen](/img/random-openings01/cochrane02.gif)

How on Earth is the king on e6 on move 6 and black isn't completely lost? Well,
the main issue is that white has exchanged its light-squared bishop and is 
substantially behind on development -- so much so in fact that black is in time
to retreat his king back to f7 and finish developing the kingside before any
attack is even possible. There is [this game](https://lichess.org/8AbF1WVX/black)
on the lichess database that shows how straight-forward it is to reach a safe
endgame (although white did have some chances to offer a more tenacious fight).
