I have finally decided to build my own blog. Not that I expect to be very active,
nor to people to find my writing appealing in any way, shape or form. Nevertheless,
I find it very interesting to have a place where I can lay out my thoughts and
essentially scream into the endless void that is the Internet. 

That's pretty much it for the introductions. If you're interested to know who
I am, do head over to my [about](/resume) page. If you want to keep reading,
just scroll around and pick whatever you fancy most.

Whatever the case, be most welcome to my mind palace.
